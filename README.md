## 1 - We will use the dataset linked at https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package. Since we are at the beginning of machine learning topics, we will not be concerned with NAN values. The variables we will use are as follows: ‘Location’, ‘MinTemp’, MaxTemp, Rainfall, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3am

### You are expected to develop a model that predicts the maximum temperature by using these variables and by using the Multiple Linear, Lasso, Ridge and Polynomial regressions we have covered so far. While performing these operations, cross validation and dummy variables will also be used. The performance measurements of the models are listed below.
- Find these performance measurements for each model.
- R2
- Root Mean Squared Error
- R2-CV
- Root Mean Squared Error-CV

##  2- The variables we will use are as follows: ‘Location’, ‘MinTemp’, MaxTemp, Rainfall, WindGustDir, WindGustSpeed, WindSpeed9am, WindSpeed3pm, Pressure9am, Pressure3pm, Humidity9am, Humidity3am, RainToday, RainTomorrow.
### You are expected to develop a model that predicts the RainTomorrow by using these variables and by using the Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Mechanism (SVM) we have covered so far.

## Which of these models is the best?

### Success!
